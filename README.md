## Visceral, Grim, & Simplistic

## INTRODUCTION

Char Grinn is a passion project that is inspired by Cacophony's Licentia Classic & Licentia Black mod pack.

Welcome to my passion project - the Char Grinn Mod List.

If you're looking for a gaming experience that's gritty and intense, you've come to the right place. This mod list is designed to enhance the atmosphere and gameplay of Skyrim AE (Best of Both Worlds version) with overhauls for combat, magic, archery, and more.

The Char Grinn Mod List comes in two profiles -

## Char Grinn
This profile is for mature audiences and contains nudity and violence. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're looking for a gaming experience that's raw and unfiltered, this is the profile for you.

## Char Grinn NSFW
If you're 18+ and looking for something even more intense, the Char Grinn NSFW profile is for you. It contains nudity, sexual content, and violence, so please use discretion when choosing to use this profile.

I have carefully curated this mod list based on my own experiences, research, & vision.  I'm confident that you'll find something that suits your taste.

_Note - modlist is a mix of 1k, 2k, & 4k texture packs to help with FPS performance.  If you choose to replace any landscape textures or worldspace additions you MUST run XLODGEN, TEXGEN, & DYNDOLOD or your LODS will not match and performance may be impacted negatively.  I have provided a tutorial and links within my Youtube video.  This ALSO applies to Grass replacement mods!!!  You MUST run Pre-Cache Grass generation or you will have performance and visuals issues._

- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)

## Optional BUT RECOMMENDED

Char Grinn Modlist was built around the following mods which GREATLY improve overall performance and gameplay.  Playing Char Grinn without these mods may result in fluctating FPS and lack of animations playing.

## INSTALLATION

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).


###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update _Skyrim_ for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), open the Properties window of _Skyrim AE_ in _Steam_, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_. It is incompatible with the profile-specific saves of a _Wabbajack_ modlist.

**Set the Game language to English**

_Wabbajack_ will check your game files and make sure that your installed version is the same as my installed version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation. You can change the game's language in the Properties window as mentioned above. It may be required to verify your files afterward.

**Install Skyrim** 

The _Anniversary Edition_ upgrade is required. No exceptions will be made. If you do not have the game installed, do so and launch the vanilla game to download all _Creation Club_ content available with the upgrade. If for some reason you have problems with your _Steam_ installation, you may need to verify the local content as described in _Steam's_ documentation.

If you didn't see / do the step in the image below when you first launch Skyrim AE, then you either don't have the AE DLC or you missed this step.  Verify your Steam files for Skyrim AE which _should_ correct this for you.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Program Files (x86)`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that _Windows_ considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory of one of your drives. (D:\ for example.)

**Do Not Use Any Protected Folders inside of OneDrive**

You will experience unusual behavior if your `My Games` folder (usually in the `Documents` folder) is part of a _OneDrive_ Cloud Folder. You will need to relocate it or disable _OneDrive._ There are no exceptions.

**Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. _Wabbajack_ and _Mod Organizer 2_ both use low-level file system virtualization which most anti-malware programs falsely detect as malicious. 

Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ don't propery respect exclusions and cannot be completely disabled -- they must be fully uninstalled. Please consider avoiding third-party anti-malware solutions and relying on _Windows Defender,_ which is more compatible with the applications used to install and play _Wabbajack_ modlists. 

**Set Pagefile to 40GB Or Above**

This can be accomplished in the System Settings for Windows. It is recommended to set the minimum and maximum pagefile size to `40,960` all on one solid state drive as mentioned above. MOre than one pagefile is not needed so long as it is large enough and located on a fast enough drive.

**Ensure Enough Free Storage Space**

As of this writing (03/15/2023) approximately **20GB** is required for the `Steam` folder, **350 GB** for the downloads folder, and **200GB** for the modlist folder. These do not all need to be on the same drive. Approximately **30GB** of free space is required on your `Windows` drive and **30GB** additional free space on your `Wabbajack` drive to leave room for temporary files, patches, and caches. Finally, never reduce the free space on any drive below **15%** (the bar in _File Manager_ will turn red) or you will suffer severe performance problems.
 

##  USING WABBAJACK

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. 

It is advised to have ALL relevant folders (for `Wabbajack.exe`, `Steam`, the modlist folder, and the downloads folder) on a solid state drive. Do not place any of these folders on a hard disk drive, flash drive, or external drive of any kind. After the list is installed, you can relocate **only** the downloads folder to such a drive (or delete it, but that may make updating difficult).


##  PROBLEMS WITH WABBAJACK

There are a lot of different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. _Wabbajack_ will only download and reinstall the bare minimum necessary to get the modlist working. 

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

I, NotSafeForAdults64 (aka deathonstilts), fully accept any responsibility for difficulties with this list and any conflicts I introduce, so please do not question mod authors on the _Nexus_, _Lover's Lab_, _Vector Plexus_ or any other site about bugs that may result from this lists' use. Direct your questions to me, not the innocent mod authors who should never be expected to support a modlist setup.

**Various files beginning with "cc" and ending with "esl" or "esm" failed to download.**

You did not purchase the $20 upgrade to Skyrim. This is not negotiable. Purchase it, verify it, delete it and re-download it if necessary, and try again.  

Again, if you don't / didn't see the below you don't have the AE version installed.

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. Try using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, you may need to delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find m-Cy game folder:**

Char Grinn will not work with a GOG or pirated version of the game. If you own the game on _Steam,_ go back to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. **DO NOT ASK FOR HELP WITH PIRATED GAMES.**

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple _Wabbajack_ lists. I can't support circumventing MEGA's bandwith restrictions so either sign up for an account or wait for the timeout to expire.
