# CHAR GRINN



## Visceral, Grim, & Simplistic

## INTRODUCTION

Char Grinn is a passion project that is inspired by Cacophony's Licentia Classic & Licentia Black mod pack.

Welcome to my passion project - the Char Grinn Mod List.

If you're looking for a gaming experience that's gritty and intense, you've come to the right place. This mod list is designed to enhance the atmosphere and gameplay of Skyrim AE (Best of Both Worlds version) with overhauls for combat, magic, archery, and more.

The Char Grinn Mod List comes in two profiles -

## Char Grinn
This profile is for mature audiences and contains nudity and violence. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're looking for a gaming experience that's raw and unfiltered, this is the profile for you.

## Char Grinn NSFW
If you're 18+ and looking for something even more intense, the Char Grinn NSFW profile is for you. It contains nudity, sexual content, and violence, so please use discretion when choosing to use this profile.

I have carefully curated this mod list based on my own experiences, research, & vision.  I'm confident that you'll find something that suits your taste.
